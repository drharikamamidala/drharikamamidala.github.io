Hello,

I am a `Health Informatics` graduate student at Sacred Heart University specializing in healthcare data analytics, interoperability, and clinical data systems.

My experience includes building analytical pipelines and dashboards using `SQL`, `Power BI` and `Python`, working with healthcare datasets (claims, hospital performance, EHR-like data), and aligning data workflows with standards such as HL7, FHIR.

My current interests include healthcare analytics, data modeling, interoperability frameworks, and clinical decision support systems.
